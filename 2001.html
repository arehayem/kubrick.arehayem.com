			<p>2001: A Space Odyssey is a 1968 British-American science fiction film produced and directed by Stanley Kubrick.
			The screenplay was written by Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, and was partially inspired by Clarke's short story
			"The Sentinel". Clarke concurrently wrote the novel 2001: A Space Odyssey which was published soon after the
			film was released. The story deals with a series of encounters between humans and mysterious black monoliths
			that are apparently affecting human evolution, and a voyage to Jupiter tracing a signal emitted by one such
			monolith found on the Moon. The film is frequently described as an epic, both for its length and scope, and
			for its affinity with classical epics. - wikipedia</p>
