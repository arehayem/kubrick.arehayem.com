			<p>Eyes Wide Shut is a 1999 American drama film based upon Arthur Schnitzler's 1926 novella Dream Story.
			The film was directed, produced, and co-written by Stanley Kubrick. It was his final film, as he died
			five days after showing Warner Bros. his final cut. The story, set in and around New York City, follows
			the sexually charged adventures of Dr. Bill Harford, who is shocked when his wife, Alice, reveals that
			she had contemplated an affair a year earlier. He embarks on a night-long adventure, during which he
			infiltrates a massive masked orgy of an unnamed secret society. - wikipedia</p>
